    - BAD: Provides the answer right away.
        ✅ Accurate: The assistant immediately gives the complete translations, which is against the instructions to avoid providing full transcriptions directly.
    - BAD: The beginner sentence is unnecessary, should just start showing the vocabulary table
        ✅ Accurate: The response spends time explaining different formalities and translations instead of going straight to the vocabulary table.
    - BAD: In the clues, we should not provide the polite form of verbs, because the student needs to figure that out.
        ✅ Accurate: The assistant provides various forms like "Könnten Sie" and "Können Sie," which are polite forms. This oversteps the instruction to only give clues and dictionary forms of words.
    -BAD: The sentence structure says too much; we really want something that is conceptual like this: [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?
        ✅ Accurate: The response does not offer a conceptual structure, making it harder for the student to understand how to build the sentence themselves.

    Okay, let's translate "Sorry, I am not from here, can you tell me where is the bathroom?" into German.  There are a few ways to say this, depending on how formal you want to be. Here are a couple of options:

    Formal:

    Entschuldigen Sie, ich bin nicht von hier. Könnten Sie mir bitte sagen, wo die Toilette ist?
    Slightly less formal:

    Entschuldigung, ich bin nicht von hier. Können Sie mir sagen, wo die Toilette ist?
    More casual (but still polite):

    Entschuldigung, ich bin nicht von hier. Wo ist die Toilette, bitte?
    Explanation of the vocabulary:

    Entschuldigen Sie/Entschuldigung: Both mean "Excuse me" or "Sorry." "Entschuldigen Sie" is more formal.
    ich bin nicht von hier: I am not from here.
    Könnten Sie mir bitte sagen...?: Could you please tell me...? (Formal)
    Können Sie mir sagen...?: Could you tell me...? (Slightly less formal)
    Wo ist...?: Where is...?
    die Toilette: The toilet/bathroom. (This is the most common and polite word to use.)
    So, which version would you like to practice with?  Let me know if you have any other sentences you'd like to translate!

    Okay, let's work on translating "Sorry, I am not from here, can you tell me where is the bathroom?" into German.  I'll guide you through it.

    First, let's break down the sentence and look at the vocabulary we'll need.  Here's a table with the German equivalents of the key words:
    | German        | English  |
    |---------------|----------|
    | Entschuldigung | Sorry    |
    | sein           | to be    |
    | kommen         | to come from |
    | hier           | here     |
    | können         | can      |
    | sagen          | to tell  |
    | wo             | where    |
    | Toilette       | bathroom |

    Remember, this table Only includes nouns, verbs, adverbs, and adjectives in their dictionary form.  You must figure out the correct articles, cases, conjugations, and any necessary particles to build a complete sentence.  Take your time and think about how these words fit together grammatically in German.  What are your initial thoughts on how to start?
