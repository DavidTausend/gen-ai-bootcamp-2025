## Functional Requirements

The platform aims to enhance language learning by providing personalized, AI-driven study activities. It should support real-time interactions, offer feedback, and adapt to individual learning paces. The system must handle concurrent usage by approximately 100 active students located in Berlin. Given concerns about user data privacy and the rising costs of managed GenAI services, the company plans to invest in owning their infrastructure. They are considering an AI PC with a budget of €4,000 to €7,000 to support this initiative.
