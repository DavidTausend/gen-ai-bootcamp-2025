## Introduction

This project uses AI to assist A1-level German learners by guiding sentence construction through hints, vocabulary, and structured feedback—without direct translations.

## Business

The platform enhances language learning with personalized, AI-driven study activities, supporting real-time interactions and adaptive feedback. It must accommodate 100 active students in Berlin while ensuring data privacy and cost-effective infrastructure. A dedicated AI PC (€4,000–€7,000 budget) is planned to optimize performance.

Your role as an AI Engineer involves:

- Developing AI-driven learning applications.

- Maintaining and improving the learning portal.

- Expanding language support while balancing scalability and privacy.

## Technologies

### Programming Languages

- [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [JavaScript](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)


### Applications, Plugins & Tools Used

[Github](https://github.com/): Github was essential for repository hosting, enabling code sharing, and project management.

[Tiny](https://tinypng.com/): TinyPNG was instrumental in compressing images and reducing file sizes without substantial quality loss.

[Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/): Used for AI-powered language translation and sentence construction guidance, helping students learn German through structured vocabulary hints and contextual feedback.

[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/): Assisted in generating language learning exercises, evaluating sentence structures, and providing real-time grammar feedback for learners.

[Claude](https://claude.ai/): Contributed to advanced text processing and interactive language learning, helping refine vocabulary usage and sentence formation.

[windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf): Used for the backend of the application with Python Flask, enabling AI-driven interactions and ensuring seamless integration with language learning tools.

## Problems

### Meta AI

I didn't use Meta AI for the project because it isn't launched yet in German, and there are delays because of data security laws within the EU.
