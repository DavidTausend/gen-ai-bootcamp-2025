## Technical Requirements

- **FastAPI** (for API framework)
- **Ollama** via the Ollama Python SDK  
  - Uses **Mistral 7B** as the primary language model

## API Endpoints

### **GetLyrics** â†’ `POST /api/agent`

#### **Behavior**
This endpoint interacts with an **agent** that follows the **ReAct framework**, allowing it to:
1. **Search the internet** for multiple versions of the target song lyrics.
2. **Analyze and select** the most accurate lyrics.
3. **Extract vocabulary** from the lyrics and format it into a structured response.

#### **Available Tools**
The agent has access to the following tools:
- `tools/extract_vocabulary.py` (Parses lyrics and extracts vocabulary)
- `tools/get_page_content.py` (Fetches webpage content)
- `tools/search_web.py` (Searches the internet for lyrics)
